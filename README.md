## 🛠 Technical Features

### Local Proxy (127.0.0.1:4323)
- Manages authentication with Vavoo servers
- Automatically renews tokens every 8-9 minutes (TOKEN_ADDON_SIG = 600 seconds)
- Provides stable URLs for bouquets
- Completely eliminates 10-minute streaming blocks
- Self-monitoring with automatic restart on failure
- Connection pool management to prevent timeouts
- **Mirror Support**: Automatic fallback between vavoo.to and kool.to when HTTP 451 is detected
- **Token Monitor**: Background thread that checks token age every 60 seconds
- **Active Stream Tracking**: Notifies proxy when streams start/end for better resource management

### EPG Integration & Satellite Priority Matching
- EPG data is generated per country and stored in `/etc/epgimport/vavoo_<country>.channels.xml`
- A master source file (`vavoo.sources.xml`) is created for EPGImport
- The player fetches EPG via the proxy redirect to GitHub raw files
- **Intelligent Channel Matching**:
  - Uses Rytec database for EPG IDs
  - Scans user-configured satellites from Enigma2 NimManager
  - Prioritizes matches from satellites the user actually has configured
  - Falls back to Italian satellites (13°E HotBird, 5°W Eutelsat) for Italian channels
  - Priority levels: Satellite > Terrestrial > Cable > IPTV
  - **Boost multipliers**: 1.5× for user-configured satellites, 1.3× for Italian satellites

### Notification System Architecture
- **Singleton Pattern**: Single manager instance across all screens
- **Thread-safe**: Lock mechanism prevents race conditions
- **Message Queue**: Pending messages stored until UI is ready
- **Auto-cleanup**: Notifications automatically hide after timeout
- **Fallback**: Console logging when UI not available

## 📋 API Endpoints
The proxy provides these endpoints:
- `/status` – Check proxy status
- `/channels?country=CountryName` – Get channels by country
- `/vavoo?channel=ChannelID` – Resolve stream URLs (302 redirect)
- `/catalog` – Full channel catalog
- `/countries` – List all countries
- `/refresh_token` – Force token refresh
- `/epg/<country>.xml` – Redirect to GitHub EPG file
- `/health` – Detailed health check with token age
- `/shutdown` – Gracefully stop proxy

## 🗂 File Management

### Bouquet Export
- Path: Plugin menu → Select country → GREEN button
- Creates bouquets with proxy URLs: `http://127.0.0.1:4323/vavoo?channel=CHANNEL_ID`
- Service references are matched against Rytec database for EPG compatibility
- EPG mapping files are automatically generated for each country
- Supports both flat bouquets and hierarchical categories

### M3U Export
- Path: Config Menu → "Generate .m3u files"
- Downloads playlist from proxy and saves as `vavoo_[country]_playlist.m3u`
- Supports single country or all countries export

### EPG Files
- Location: `/etc/epgimport/vavoo_*.channels.xml`
- Source: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Belfagor2005/vavoo-player/master/epg_<country>.xml`
- Updated automatically via GitHub Actions every 6 hours

### Cache Files
- **EPG Cache**: `/etc/enigma2/vavoo_epg_cache.json` – Persistent cache of matched channels with Rytec IDs
  ```json
  {
    "channel_name_country": {
      "id": "rytec_id",
      "sref": "4097:0:1:1773:60E1:217C:5A0000:0:0:0:",
      "name": "channel_name",
      "country": "it",
      "matched": true,
      "timestamp": "2026-03-19 10:23:15"
    }
  }
  ```

- **Unmatched Cache**: `/etc/enigma2/vavoo_epg_unmatched_cache.json` – Stores channels that couldn't be matched
  ```json
  {
    "channel_name_country": {
      "id": "channel_name_country",
      "name": "channel_name",
      "country": "it",
      "sref": "4097:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:",
      "timestamp": "2026-03-19 10:23:15",
      "matched": false,
      "attempts": 3
    }
  }
  ```
  Features:
  - Tracks matching attempts count
  - Auto-converts old format entries
  - Persistent across plugin restarts
  - Used for future matching improvements

- **SREF Map**: `/etc/enigma2/vavoo_sref_map.json` – Maps service references to channel IDs for the proxy

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Quick Diagnostics
```bash
# Check proxy status
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:4323/status

# Check proxy logs
cat /tmp/vavoo_proxy.log

# Check plugin logs
cat /tmp/vavoo.log

# Check EPG cache
cat /etc/enigma2/vavoo_epg_cache.json

# Check unmatched cache
cat /etc/enigma2/vavoo_epg_unmatched_cache.json

# Check proxy health
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:4323/health
```

### Common Issues
| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "No channels found" | Restart plugin, check internet connection |
| Bouquets don't open | Ensure proxy is running (check with curl) |
| Stream doesn't start | Proxy should auto-refresh tokens |
| M3U export fails | Verify port 4323 is accessible |
| "No programme found" | Clear EPG cache and re-export bouquet; check country EPG file exists |
| EPG not updating | Verify EPG is enabled in config and GitHub files are accessible |
| HTTP 451 errors | Proxy automatically switches to mirror sites (kool.to) |
| Duplicate cache entries | Press YELLOW button in main menu to fix cache format |

### Notification Issues
| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Only first notification shows | Ensure `init_notification_system(session)` is called once in `MainVavoo` |
| Notifications from background don't appear | The singleton manager now handles this automatically |
| Message appears truncated | Check Python 2/3 encoding in notification text |
| Notifications too fast/slow | Adjust duration parameter in `quick_notify(message, seconds)` |

### Cache Issues
| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Unmatched channels not saving | Check write permissions to `/etc/enigma2/` |
| Duplicate unmatched entries | Press YELLOW button or run `fix_cache_format(remove_duplicates=True)` |
| Cache file corrupted | Delete the file and restart - it will be regenerated |
| Old format entries | The plugin auto-converts them on read or use YELLOW button |

## 📝 Important Notes
- **Notifications are thread-safe** – You can call `quick_notify()` from any background thread
- **Message queue system** ensures no notifications are lost during plugin startup
- **Unmatched channels are persistent** – They survive plugin restarts and are used for future matching attempts
- **Attempts counter** helps track how many times a channel has been processed
- **EPG cache now includes matched/unmatched status** – Each entry has a `matched: true/false` flag
- **Satellite priority** – The plugin reads your Enigma2 satellite configuration and prioritizes those channels
- Old bouquets won't work with new system – re-export required
- Proxy runs in background – bouquets work even after closing plugin
- Minimal memory usage (~20-50MB)
- Use **TEXT button** in main menu to manually refresh proxy token
- Use **YELLOW button** to fix cache format
- Proxy status is displayed in real-time in the main interface
